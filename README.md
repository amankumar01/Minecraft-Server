# Minecraft-Server
This is a currently private minecraft server used to make plugins and setup networking for future possible release
Created to tinker around with ideas that I wanted to implement using my own knowledge as well as a learning opportunity to interact with the Bukkit/Spigot API

Some of these ideas have already been implemented by other plugin developers, however the purpose of this project is to create my own version of those ideas.
